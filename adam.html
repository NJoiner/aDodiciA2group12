												<h3>About Me</h3>
												<p>Greetings! I was born in NSW Australia, and am currently living in Sydney. My cultural background is Greek on my mother’s side 
												and Croatian on my father’s side. I graduated High School in 2016 and have been working in a computer sales, installation and repair 
												store since. Some of my hobbies include playing the guitar, playing video games, cooking & baking, and playing around with video editing & graphic design.</p>

													<h3>Interests In IT</h3>
													<p>I have been extremely interested in the hardware and software aspects of IT since I was young, from how computers and software run to 
													how it can make my life easier. My father was the one to introduce me to, and teach me about all thing IT, and I experimented and played 
													around with all the technologies I could get my hands on throughout my life. I love to learn about the latest and greatest IT inventions, 
													with a lot of my main IT interests being game design, software development, machine learning and computer graphics.</p>

												<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
												<p>Currently, my ideal job is as a Lead Software Developer, requiring management and execution of large development projects, technical work, 
												mentorship and management of team members. I love the design, development and programming aspects of IT work, and would especially love to work 
												on projects that help people. Portable Pty Ltd is a company which I would consider working for as they strive to create a positive impact on 
												people in the areas of mental health, education, access to justice and death & ageing in collaboration with organisations like Headspace.</p>
