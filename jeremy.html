												<h3>About Me</h3>
												<p>My background is Malaysian/Chinese, I have completed part of a Bachelor of Education (Primary) course, English is my first and only language so far. I think that one interesting but alarming fact about me is that I have seen around 16,000 episodes of TV and have watched almost 2000 films/movies.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h3>Interest in IT</h3>
												<p>IT is something I’m interested in because it is such a huge part of our world today. I think that IT is an important skill to be knowledgeable about especially in the growing climate of the world. The cybersecurity aspect of IT is what mostly fascinates me. I started having an interest in IT when I started to be really interested in gaming and also the hardware aspect of IT.
												I wouldn’t say there was a particular event or person that I can recall that sparked my interest. I would say that it was my gaming that got me started and then gradually YouTube videos about what was new that was coming out and all the amazing inventions people were making through IT. I chose to come to RMIT online because I have heard of the university before.
												It also was appealing because it was a technology focused university and therefore would have a lot of knowledge to give on the subjects I was interested in.
												I expect to learn how to effectively use technology in the world around me. </p>

												<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
												<p>At this moment in time I think that the job that is most appealing in IT is an IT technician. This job appeals to me most because it involves helping people with problems that may arise.
											I work in an office role at the moment and one day I would want to move to the IT support role. This job can also be done from remote areas away from which I like as well and while I only have some basic skills at the moment I
											think that I would stick to this type of role for my future. </p>
										</div>
										<div>
											<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
													<p>I have taken three different personality tests to outline my personal profile. </p>
													<p>The three personality tests I have taken are the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">Myer Briggs</a>, <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/" target="_blank">Big 5 Personality</a>
													 , and the <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/NPAS/" target="_blank">Nerdy Test</a> tests.</p>
