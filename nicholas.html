												<h3>About Me</h3>
												<p>I live in Victoria, Australia, I have mostly worked in the corporate Aviation but for the last few years I have worked in a family business Dromkeen, the home of children’s literature and artwork.
													For the last few years at Dromkeen we have held literature festivals and various exhibitions in which I have been involved heavily in, from website content management to audio-visual setup and management.
													I am currently a student enrolled in 'Introduction to Information Technology' and 'Introduction to Programming' through Open Universities Australia, studying at RMIT. Through my studies at RMIT I hope to open
													 opportunities within the IT industry.

												<h3>Interests In IT</h3>
												<p>From an early age, I have always been fascinated with different forms of Technology. I have enjoyed building and maintaining computers, deconstructing and fixing various laptops and mobile phone devices
													around the house. I try to keep informed about the various technological inovations and news from around the world. I also have an interest in how different devices seamlessly interact with each other. I also
													look after the 'Dromkeen' website(using wordpress) and social media content. Information Technology is like Aviation in the from aspect that there is a lot of problem-solving is involved and that you have to
													troubleshot and understood how a particular system works to enable you to find a solution.</p>

												<h3>Ideal Job In IT</h3>
												<p>I originally thought my ideal job would be designing/implementing technology solutions for businesses, in a role such as a “Technology Solutions Consultant”. But after doing some research, I believe I would be more
													 suited for a sole such as a “Front End Web Developer”.</p>
												<p>Dilate Digital is a Digital Marketing Agency, which focuses on implementing digital business marketing strategies to enable clients to target their audience effectively. They effectively work on four fundamental
													principles discover, build, launch and grow. They are looking for someone to implement and build highly function and clean websites that are fundamentally SEO(Search Engine Optimised), this allows the business to
													show as the top result for specific keywords. I hope that through RMIT I will learn all the skills required for a job like this.</p>

													<h3>Personality Profile</h3>
													<p>I have taken three different personality test to outline my personal profile. </p>
													<p>The three personality tests I have taken are the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target="_blank">Myer Briggs</a>, <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/" target="_blank">Big 5 Personality</a>
													 , and the <a href="http://www.educationplanner.org/students/self-assessments/learning-styles-quiz.shtml" target="_blank">Learning Style</a> tests.</p>
