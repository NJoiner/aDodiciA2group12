										<h3>Individual Group Reflections</h3>

										<h4>Jacopo</h4>
										<p>When I started this group project, I had very low expectations. I thought that people would not be committed enough, that I would have to chase them to get things done and compensate with extra work on me. The truth is that I was pleasantly surprised. Group aDodici cooperated very efficiently from the very beginning. We were able to distribute the work without any issue, identify our team ‘roles’ and get everything done with no delays. All my team members were very honest about their strengths and weaknesses, and that helped us understand how to contribute to this project at our best. </p>
										<p>Our team had to face a small problem. We started as a group of six, but one member disappeared after the second week and he did not bother to let us know that he dropped out of the course. This was a good test for us, and I was glad to see that we had absolutely no problems reorganising our tasks and responsibilities. This taught me how open-mindedness, flexibility and problem solving are fundamental skills to have when working in a team.</p>
										<p>One thing that we could improve moving forward is communication. Although all of us were very responsive once received the information, we sometimes took a bit too long to get back to each other and ended up not being able to make necessary changes to the weekly plan. Faster communication could lead to better flexibility and therefore more productivity.</p>

										<p>When I heard that we had to do group projects quite early on in the course I was very nervous. I was especially alarmed because the course is online and I couldn’t gauge and get to know people in the course before making a group. After the first lecture I was pleasantly surprised to find that I had a group quick and easy. 
											It was very encouraging to see how helpful everyone in the course was. I thought that we would maybe get some people who weren’t as active and committed and everyone has been really great. I really appreciate that our group is very flexible, understanding, responsible, and honest.</p>
<p>Definitely one thing I think I could improve on moving forward is being proactive and really being responsive. I appreciate the amount of work my group has done and I want to be a valued member. I also guess I want to feel less afraid of sounding stupid. I really am out of my comfort zone getting serious about IT. So, in the next few assignments I want to be able to take on more and give it my all. </p>
